I am currently a second-year Master's student in the <a href="https://math.tufts.edu/"  target="_blank"> Math Department</a> at Tufts University, focusing on applied mathematics and fortunate to be under the guidance of <a href="https://math.tufts.edu/people/faculty/abiy-tasissa" target="_blank">Abiy Tasissa</a>.

My academic interests are primarily centered around Applied Analysis and Computational Mathematics, with a particular focus on Numerical Analysis, Optimization (both linear and non-linear), and Topological Data Analysis. I find great satisfaction in exploring how mathematical tools and techniques can be pragmatically applied to address complex societal challenges.

During the past summer, I had the privilege of serving as a researcher in the <a href="https://math.tufts.edu/people/faculty/abiy-tasissa" target="_blank">MGGG Lab</a>, where I had the valuable opportunity to work under the mentorship of  <a href="https://mggg.org/people/mduchin/" target="_blank">Moon Duchin</a>. In this role, I contributed to research on data science interventions for civil rights.

Before embarking on my graduate journey at Tufts, I earned my Bachelor of Arts degree in Africana Studies from <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/africana-studies" target="_blank">Oberlin College</a>, where I also minored in Mathematics and Economics. I owe a debt of gratitude to the mentors who guided me during my undergraduate years: <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/arts-and-sciences/departments/africana-studies" target="_blank">James A. Walsh </a>,
<a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/gillian-johns" target="_blank">Gillian Johns </a> , <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/daphne-john" target="_blank">Daphne John </a>, <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/darko-opoku" target="_blank">Darko Opoku </a>, <a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/wendy-beth-hyman" target="_blank">Wendy Hyman =</a>, and<a href="https://www.oberlin.edu/daphne-john" target="_blank"> Monique Burgdorf </a> .

Furthermore, I had the privilege of completing a <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/graduate/mathematics-postbaccalaureate" target="_blank">Post-Baccalaureate program in Mathematics at Smith College =</a>, where I received nurturing mentorship from <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/candice-price" target="_blank">Candice Price </a>, <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/lindsay-poirier" target="_blank">Lindsay Poirier =</a>, <a href="=https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/julianna-tymoczko" target="_blank"> Julianna Tymoczko </a>, and <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/christophe-gole" target="_blank"> Christophe GoleÂ´ </a>. Their support has been instrumental in shaping my academic journey.
